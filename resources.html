            <h2>Best Practices to Avoid Phishing</h2>
            <p>By implementing these best practices, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to a phishing attack.</p>

            <!-- Protect Accounts & Devices -->
            <h3>Protect Your Accounts and Devices</h3>
            <ul class="details-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Enable MFA on all your sensitive accounts such as email, banking, social media. This requires a second form of verification like a code sent to your phone, making it extremely difficult for a thief to log in, even if they steal your password.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords:</strong> Create long, complex passwords that combine letters, numbers, and symbols. Never reuse the same password across multiple accounts. A password manager can help you manage unique passwords securely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> Enable automatic updates for your operating system, web browser, and security software. Updates often include critical security patches that protect against new threats.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Install Antivirus/Anti-Malware Software:</strong> Use reputable security software and keep its virus definitions up-to-date to scan for and remove malicious files.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Safe Online Behavior -->
            <h3>Safe Online Behavior</h3>
            <ul class="details-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Never Click the Link:</strong> If a message is suspicious, do not click the link or open the attachment. Instead, open a new browser window and type the company's official website address directly into the address bar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Verify Independently:</strong> If you receive a warning about an account problem (like a bank, credit card, utility bill, etc.), contact the company using a known, trusted method like the phone number on the back of your card or their official website. **Do not** use the contact information provided in the suspicious message.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Check for HTTPS:</strong> Before you enter any sensitive information on a website, ensure the URL starts with <code>https://</code> and a padlock icon is present in the address bar. This indicates the connection is encrypted and more likely to be secure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Be Careful with Public Wi-Fi:</strong> Avoid conducting sensitive activities like online banking or shopping while connected to unsecured public Wi-Fi networks. Consider using a VPN for extra protection.
                </li>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">If you realize you have clicked a suspicious link or entered credentials on a fake site, act immediately:</p>
            <ul class="details-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Change Passwords:</strong> Immediately change the passwords for the compromised account and any other account that uses the same password.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Monitor Accounts:</strong> Review your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorized transactions. Contact your financial institutions immediately if you see anything suspicious.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Scan Your Device:</strong> Run a full scan using your anti-malware software to check for and remove any malware that may have been downloaded.
