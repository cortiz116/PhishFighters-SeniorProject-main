            <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
            <p>
                Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where a criminal,
                masquerading as a trusted entity like a bank, co-worker, or government agency,
                attempts to trick you into revealing sensitive information. This information
                can include usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other financial data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The term "phishing" comes from the idea that attackers use an
                enticing "lure" to "fish" for a victim's personal data.
            </p>

            <h2>How Phishing Works</h2>
            <p>The attack usually follows a few simple steps:</p>
            
            <ul class="attack-steps">
                <li>
                    <strong>The Lure:</strong> The attacker sends a fraudulent
                    message—often an email, text, or call—that appears legitimate and creates
                    a sense of urgency, fear, or excitement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Hook:</strong> The message asks you to take an
                    action, such as clicking a link, opening an attachment, or replying with
                    personal information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Catch:</strong> If you click the link, you're
                    often taken to a fake website that looks identical to a real one. Any
                    information you enter on this fake site is stolen by the attacker. If you
                    open an attachment, it may install malware on your device.
                </li>
            </ul>

                        <strong>More Details:</strong>This is the classic "bulk" phishing attack, sent to millions of people. It often impersonates large, well-known companies like Microsoft, Google, or your bank, using generic greetings.

                       <strong>More Details:</strong> Smishing uses text messages to create urgency. You might get a text about a "package delivery issue" or a "suspicious login" with a link. These are especially dangerous because people tend to trust texts more than emails.

                            <strong>More Details:</strong> Unlike bulk phishing, a spear phishing email is customized. The attacker will research you online (e.g., from LinkedIn) and use your name, job title, or a colleague's name to build trust and make the email seem highly credible.
